- [ ] Biết personal preferences: pace (relaxed vs packed), interests, dietary needs

### Tools/Access Cần Có
- [ ] OpenClaw với web search enabled (crucial cho real-time info)
- [ ] Browser (để verify opening hours, book tickets)
- [ ] Maps app (Google Maps, Apple Maps) cho navigation
- [ ] (Optional) Translation app nếu non-English destination

- [ ] Interests: history, food, art, nightlife, nature, shopping...
- [ ] Mobility constraints (walking ability, public transport comfort)
- [ ] Dietary restrictions/preferences

---

## 🚀 Instructions (Hướng Dẫn Từng Bước)

### Step 1: Map the Territory
**Action:** Research city layout và key districts
**Details:**
- Identify neighborhoods: Old Town, financial district, artsy areas...
- Note clustering của attractions (which are near each other?)
- Understand transportation: subway lines, bus routes, walkability
- Mark accommodation location relative to attractions

**Expected Result:** Mental map hoặc list của districts và their highlights

---

### Step 2: Identify Anchor Points
**Action:** Chọn 2-3 "must-see" anchors mỗi ngày
**Details:**
- Day 1: Mix của iconic landmarks và local culture
- Day 2: Deeper dive hoặc contrast với Day 1
- Consider: opening hours, advance booking needs, peak times
- Balance: không quá 3 major sites mỗi ngày để tránh fatigue

**Expected Result:** 4-6 anchor attractions với timing estimates

---

### Step 3: Plan the Culinary Journey
**Action:** Curate meal experiences không chỉ là "eating"
**Details:**
- **Breakfast:** Local specialty hoặc fuel-up spot
- **Lunch:** Casual, quick, near afternoon activities
- **Dinner:** Sit-down experience, local cuisine, reservation needed?
- **Snacks/Coffee:** Local specialties, people-watching spots
- Consider dietary restrictions và budget tiers

**Expected Result:** 6-8 food stops với variety của experiences

---

### Step 4: Optimize Routes
**Action:** Arrange activities theo geography, không chỉ interest
**Details:**
- Group nearby attractions để minimize travel time
- Consider: morning light cho photos, evening atmosphere
- Build in buffer time: 15-30 min between activities
- Have Plan B indoor options cho bad weather

**Expected Result:** Logical flow từ one area to another

---

### Step 5: Add Local Texture
**Action:** Include experiences beyond typical tourist spots
**Details:**
- Local markets (morning is best)
- Neighborhood walks không có destination cụ thể
- Viewpoints (sunrise, sunset, night views)
- Local events/festivals nếu có
- "Only in [city]" experiences

**Expected Result:** Unique moments distinguish từ generic itineraries

---

### Step 6: Build Flexibility
**Action:** Tạo options cho different energy levels và interests
**Details:**
- **Relaxed version:** Skip optional stops, longer meals
- **Extended version:** Add nearby day trip hoặc deeper dive
- **Bad weather backup:** Indoor alternatives cho outdoor activities
- **Evening options:** Early night vs nightlife explorer

**Expected Result:** Itinerary adapts to actual travel conditions

---

### Step 7: Logistics và Prep
**Action:** Finalize practical details
**Details:**
- Check opening hours (many museums closed Mondays!)
- Note advance booking requirements
- List transportation passes/options
- Emergency contacts và useful apps
- Packing suggestions specific to itinerary

**Expected Result:** Ready-to-use guide với all necessary info
