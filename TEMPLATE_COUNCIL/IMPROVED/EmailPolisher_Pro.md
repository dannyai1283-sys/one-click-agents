## 💡 Example Usage (Ví Dụ Cụ Thể)

**Input của bạn:**
```
Context:
- Recipient: Sarah Chen, Marketing Director at TechCorp
- Relationship: Client (working together 3 months)
- Formality: Professional
- Purpose: Request deadline extension
- Urgency: Medium

Raw Draft:
"Hi Sarah, so about the website redesign deliverables. We hit some issues with the third-party API integration. Took longer than expected. Also the design team found some accessibility issues that need fixing. Won't make Friday deadline. Need one more week. Can we push to next Friday? Sorry about this. The team is working overtime to fix it. Will send progress update tomorrow."
```

**Cách sử dụng template:**
1. Fill context section
2. Paste raw draft
3. Run template
4. Review 2 options
5. Customize và send

**Output mong đợi:**

**Option A: Direct & Concise**

**Subject:** Website Redesign Timeline Update - Extension Requested

Dear Sarah,

I hope this email finds you well. I'm writing to request a one-week extension for the website redesign deliverables, moving the deadline from this Friday to next Friday.

We've encountered two unforeseen technical challenges:

1. **API Integration Complexity:** The third-party API integration is requiring more development time than initially scoped
2. **Accessibility Compliance:** Our QA process identified accessibility issues that must be resolved before launch

Our team is working extended hours to resolve these issues and maintain quality standards. I'll send you a detailed progress update tomorrow morning.

Would next Friday work for your timeline? I'm happy to discuss any concerns or adjustments needed.

Best regards,
[Your name]

---

**Option B: Warm & Relationship-Building**

**Subject:** Quick Update on Website Redesign Timeline

Hi Sarah,

I hope you're having a great week! I wanted to reach out regarding the website redesign project and give you a heads-up on our timeline.

As we dove deeper into the development phase, our team discovered two important items that will ensure the final product meets both our quality standards and accessibility requirements:

- The third-party API integration is proving more complex than initially anticipated
- We've identified some accessibility compliance issues that need attention before launch

To deliver the polished, professional website you expect, we're requesting to move the deadline from this Friday to next Friday. Our team is putting in extra hours to make sure we stay as close to the original timeline as possible.

I'll share a comprehensive progress update with you tomorrow so you can see exactly where we stand. Would the extension to next Friday work for your schedule?

Thanks so much for your understanding, Sarah. We really appreciate the flexibility.

Warm regards,
[Your name]

## ⚠️ Common Pitfalls (Lỗi Thường Gặp)

### Pitfall 1: Over-Polishing (Losing Voice)
**What:** Email nghe quá generic, mất personal touch
**Why it happens:** AI over-standardize theo "professional" template
**How to avoid:** Add instruction: "Maintain my personal voice and style, just improve clarity"

### Pitfall 2: Mismatch in Formality
**What:** Email quá formal với colleague thân, hoặc quá casual với senior
**How to avoid:** Chọn đúng formality level trong context

### Pitfall 3: Buried Lead
**What:** Main point ẩn ở giữa paragraph thay vì prominent
**How to avoid:** Verify "ask" hoặc main point ở đầu hoặc highlighted

### Pitfall 4: Over-Apologizing
**What:** Quá nhiều "sorry" làm bạn trông không confident
**How to avoid:** Edit out excessive apologies, focus on solutions

### Pitfall 5: CC/BCC Faux Pas
**What:** Reply-all khi không cần thiết, hoặc forget CC important person
**How to avoid:** Double-check recipient list trước khi send

---

## 🛡️ Safety Notes (Lưu Ý An Toàn)

### ⚠️ Limitations
- AI có thể miss cultural nuances hoặc industry-specific terminology
- Template không thể capture organizational politics hoặc sensitive dynamics
- Legal/contractual language nên được lawyer review

### 🚫 Don't Do This
- **Đừng** dùng cho legal notices, termination letters, hoặc formal complaints mà không review
- **Đừng** copy-paste AI output cho highly sensitive personal matters
- **Đừng** dùng để ghostwrite mà không disclose khi appropriate
- **Đừng** send email với placeholders chưa replaced ([Your name], [Date])

## 📧 Email Etiquette Warnings

### CC/BCC Best Practices

**When to use CC (Carbon Copy):**
- Ngườii cần biết thông tin nhưng không cần hành động
- Transparency với stakeholders
- Keeping managers in the loop

**When to use BCC (Blind Carbon Copy):**
- Giữ privacy của recipients (newsletters, mass emails)
- Remove someone from thread politely
- Introducing contacts who shouldn't see each other's emails

**⚠️ CC/BCC Etiquette Violations:**
- [ ] Don't CC someone's manager without warning
- [ ] Don't BCC to "catch" someone in a lie
- [ ] Don't Reply All when only sender needs response
- [ ] Don't add new people to thread without context

### Reply Timing Expectations

| Relationship | Expected Response | Acceptable Delay |
|--------------|-------------------|------------------|
| **Internal team** | Within 4-8 hours | Same business day |
| **Cross-functional** | Within 24 hours | 1 business day |
| **External client** | Within 24 hours | 1 business day |
| **Senior leadership** | Within 2-4 hours | Same day |
| **Cold outreach** | N/A | No expectation |

**⚠️ Timing Etiquette:**
- Don't send emails outside business hours expecting immediate response
- Use "Send Later" feature for off-hours composition
- Mark truly urgent emails with "URGENT:" sparingly

### Subject Line Etiquette

**✅ DO:**
- Keep under 50 characters (mobile-friendly)
- Use action prefixes: [ACTION REQUIRED], [FYI], [DECISION NEEDED]
- Be specific: "Q4 Budget Approval - Due Friday" vs "Budget Question"
- Update subject when topic changes

**❌ DON'T:**
- Use ALL CAPS (feels like shouting)
- Leave subject blank
- Use vague subjects: "Question", "Meeting", "Hi"
- Mark everything as "URGENT"

### Attachment Etiquette

**Before Sending Attachments:**
- [ ] File names are descriptive (not "Document1.pdf")
- [ ] File size under 10MB (use links for larger files)
- [ ] Correct file format (PDF for read-only, editable formats when needed)
- [ ] Virus scanned

**Cloud Storage Links vs Attachments:**
- Use Drive/Dropbox links for:
  - Files > 10MB
  - Collaborative documents
  - Version-controlled files
- Attach directly for:
  - Final signed documents
  - Small reference files
  - When recipient needs offline access

### Email Tone Warnings

**Avoid These Tone Mistakes:**

1. **Passive-Aggressive Phrases**
   - ❌ "Per my last email..."
   - ❌ "As previously mentioned..."
   - ❌ "Just a friendly reminder..."
   - ✅ Instead: Direct, clear restatement

2. **Over-Apologizing**
   - ❌ "Sorry to bother you..."
   - ❌ "Sorry for the long email..."
   - ❌ "Sorry, but I think..."
   - ✅ Instead: Get to the point confidently

3. **Weak Language**
   - ❌ "I just wanted to..."
   - ❌ "I was wondering if maybe..."
   - ❌ "Perhaps we could possibly..."
   - ✅ Instead: "I need...", "Can you...", "Let's..."

4. **Emoji Overuse**
   - ❌ Multiple emojis in professional contexts
   - ❌ Emoji with senior leadership (unless they use first)
   - ✅ Instead: Conservative use, mirror recipient's style

### Cross-Cultural Email Etiquette

**High-Context Cultures (Asia, Middle East, Latin America):**
- Build relationship before business
- Use formal titles until invited otherwise
- Expect longer, more contextual emails

**Low-Context Cultures (US, Germany, Scandinavia):**
- Get to the point quickly
- Direct communication valued
- Shorter emails preferred

**Formality by Region:**
| Region | Greeting Style | Sign-off |
|--------|---------------|----------|
| **US/Canada** | First name acceptable | Best, Thanks |
| **UK** | First name (after intro) | Kind regards, Cheers |
| **Germany** | Herr/Frau + Last name | Mit freundlichen Grüßen |
| **Japan** | San suffix, formal | Yoroshiku onegaishimasu |
| **India** | Sir/Madam initially | Regards, Warm regards |

### Legal & Compliance Warnings

**Confidentiality Markers:**
- Use "CONFIDENTIAL:" in subject for sensitive info
- Add disclaimer footer when required
- Mark "ATTORNEY-CLIENT PRIVILEGED" when applicable

**GDPR/CCPA Considerations:**
- Don't send PII (Personally Identifiable Information) unnecessarily
- Use BCC for mass emails
- Include unsubscribe link for marketing emails
- Retain emails according to company policy

**Industry-Specific Compliance:**
- **Healthcare:** HIPAA - don't include PHI in email
- **Finance:** FINRA/SEC - retain all business communications
- **Legal:** Attorney-client privilege markers
- **Government:** FOIA compliance - assume public record

### Email Signature Etiquette

**Standard Professional Signature:**
```
Name
Title | Company
Phone | Email
[Optional: LinkedIn profile]
[Optional: Company tagline]
```

**Signature Don'ts:**
- [ ] Don't use images that don't load properly
- [ ] Don't include inspirational quotes
- [ ] Don't list every certification (keep it clean)
- [ ] Don't use colorful fonts or backgrounds
- [ ] Don't include "Sent from my iPhone" (disable this)

### 💰 Cost Implications
- AI polishing: Free với most assistants
- No additional costs cho standard email

### 🔒 Data Privacy
- Email drafts có thể chứa confidential business information
- Không paste proprietary information lên public AI nếu không có enterprise security
- Consider using local/private AI cho highly sensitive communications
- Be aware rằng AI providers may store inputs (check privacy policy)

## 🎓 Pro Tips (Mẹo Chuyên Nghiệp)

2. **Subject Line Testing:** Viết 3-5 subject lines, pick one phù hợp nhất với urgency và relationship.

3. **The BLUF Method:** Bottom Line Up Front - đặt main point/request ở đầu email cho busy recipients.

4. **Schedule Send:** Dùng scheduled send để email arrive vào khung giờ optimal (8-9 AM Tuesday-Thursday cho business emails).

## 🐛 Troubleshooting (Xử Lý Sự Cố)

### Issue: AI output quá generic
**Symptoms:** Email nghe giống "template", thiếu personality
**Solution:** Thêm specific details vào raw draft: tên dự án cụ thể, ngày tháng, context riêng

### Issue: Wrong tone
**Symptoms:** Quá formal hoặc quá casual
**Solution:** Adjust formality level trong context, thêm example: "Tone should be similar to talking with a respected colleague"

### Issue: Missing key information
**Symptoms:** AI bỏ sót details quan trọng từ raw draft
**Solution:** Bullet point raw draft thay vì paragraph, hoặc add instruction: "Ensure all dates, numbers, và names từ raw draft được include"

### Issue: Too long
**Symptoms:** Email dài dòng, recipient sẽ không đọc hết
**Solution:** Add constraint: "Keep under 150 words" hoặc "Executive summary format"
