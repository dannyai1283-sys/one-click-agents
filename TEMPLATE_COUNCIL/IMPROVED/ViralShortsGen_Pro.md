---

## 📋 Step-by-Step Instructions

### Step 1: Trend Intelligence Gathering

**What to do**: Research current trends in your niche

**Why**: Viral content rides existing waves, not creates them

**How**:
```
1. Search "[niche] trends TikTok 2025"
2. Search "[niche] viral sounds/audio 2025"
3. Browse [platform] for top performers in last 7 days
4. Note: Hook styles, video formats, audio trends
5. Identify: Pattern of top 5 viral videos in niche
```

**What to capture**:
- Trending audio/sounds (3-5 options)
- Hook styles working now (list patterns)
- Video length of top performers
- Hashtag combinations
- Visual style (raw vs polished)

**Expected result**: Trend briefing document

---

### Step 2: Hook Engineering

**What to do**: Create 3 scroll-stopping hooks

**Why**: First 3 seconds determine 80% of retention

**Hook Formula** (Choose based on niche):

| Hook Type | Best For | Template |
|-----------|----------|----------|
| **Pattern Interrupt** | Educational | "Stop! You're doing [X] wrong..." |
| **Curiosity Gap** | Storytelling | "I discovered [surprising thing] and..." |
| **Contrarian** | Opinion | "[Popular belief] is actually a scam..." |
| **Relatability** | Lifestyle | "POV: You're [situation]..." |
| **Urgency** | News/Trends | "This just happened and nobody's talking about it..." |
| **Transformation** | Before/After | "I went from [X] to [Y] in [time]..." |

**Generate 3 variations**:
```
Hook 1 (Pattern Interrupt): ________________
Hook 2 (Contrarian): ________________
Hook 3 (Curiosity): ________________
```

**Select best** based on:
- Authenticity to your voice
- Trend alignment
- Audience relevance

---

### Step 3: Script Development

**What to do**: Write complete 45-60 second script

**Structure**:
```
0-3s:   HOOK (selected from Step 2)
3-15s:  PROBLEM/SETUP (establish stakes)
15-45s: SOLUTION/VALUE (main content)
45-55s: CTA (engagement prompt)
55-60s: OUTRO (branding/sign-off)
```

**Script Format**:
Use two-column format for production clarity.

---

### Step 4: Production Metadata

**What to do**: Package for filming

**Include**:
- Video title (hook-optimized)
- Caption (with hashtags)
- Cover text suggestion
- Posting time recommendation
- Audio selection

---

#### Script (50 seconds)

| Time | Visual | Audio |
|------|--------|-------|

| 3-8s | Cut to: Messy bed, phone alarm | "Here's why..." |

| 20-35s | Show research/screenshots: Sleep studies, chronotypes | "Then I found the research. Your optimal wake time depends on your chronotype..." |
| 35-45s | Personal clip: Energetic at 8AM vs drained at 5AM | "When I shifted to MY natural rhythm, my productivity 3x'd without the misery..." |

#### Production Metadata

## ⚠️ Common Pitfalls

| Pitfall | Why It Happens | How to Avoid |

## 🆘 Troubleshooting

| Problem | Likely Cause | Solution |
|---------|--------------|----------|
| "Can't find trends" | Niche too narrow | Broaden search; look at adjacent niches |
| "Hooks feel forced" | Wrong hook type | Test different hook styles; match to personality |
| "Script too long" | Over-explaining | Cut to 1 key point; make series for multiple points |
| "No engagement" | Weak CTA | Make CTA specific and easy ("Comment YES if...") |
| "Trend died before posting" | Slow production | Batch create; prioritize evergreen content |
