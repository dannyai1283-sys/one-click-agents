# AI Agents: The One-Click Blueprint (Powered by OpenClaw)

This is a **Zero-Friction** repository designed to get your personal AI Agent up and running in under 5 minutes. This project is the official companion to the book **"AI Agents: The One-Click Blueprint"** by Danny Ho.

## 🌟 The "Living Repository" Strategy
This isn't just a static project. It is an **Open-Source Community Hub**. 
- **The Book** provides the foundation and the "how-to".
- **This Repo** provides the "engine" and a growing library of community-contributed templates.

## 🚀 One-Click Setup
1.  **Clone this repo:** `git clone https://github.com/your-username/one-click-agents.git`
2.  **Run the installer:** `bash setup.sh`
3.  **Add your keys:** Paste your Antigravity API Key in `.env`.
4.  **Start Chatting:** Talk to your bot on Telegram/Discord.

## 🛠️ Project Structure
- `config/`: Pre-optimized configurations with smart fallbacks.
- `templates/`: Professional prompts for Writing, Coding, and Research.
- `community_templates/`: 👈 **Submit yours here!** This is where our readers share their best agent configurations.

## 🤝 Join the Movement
We invite all readers to contribute!
- Have a prompt that writes better emails?
- Built a configuration for an automated legal assistant?
- Created a specialized agent for teachers or students?

**Contribute your templates and get featured in the book's next edition!** See `CONTRIBUTING.md` for details.
